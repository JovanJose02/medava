1. How does the JVM actually implement dynamic dispatch (virtual methods) at the low level?
2. How does Java decide which overridden method to call at runtime when a variable is typed as a superclass but stores a subclass object?
3. Why are enumerations in Java full classes instead of just named integers like in C?
4. When would you choose reflection instead of interfaces, given that reflection is slower and less type-safe?
5. What are the trade-offs between using abstract classes vs interfaces in Java?
6. Why does reflection need wrapper types like Double instead of primitive double in getMethod?
